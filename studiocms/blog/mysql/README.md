# StudioCMS - Blog Template

This is a headful setup for StudioCMS - the frontend will be generated for you, using `@studiocms/blog`. 

```bash
npm create studiocms@latest -- --template studiocms/blog
```

Welcome to your new StudioCMS project! Here's a quick checklist to get you started:

- [x] Run the install command with your favorite package manager
- [ ] Make sure your [`.env` variables](https://docs.studiocms.dev/start-here/environment-variables/) are set
- [ ] Push your DB schema by running `npm run migrate`
- [ ] Start dev server (`npm run dev`) and go through the first time setup

Once you're done, you can tweak your configuration for StudioCMS in the `studiocms.config.mjs` file and start authoring content!
